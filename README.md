# video_annotation

Project to annotate videos with formal knowledge, using semantic embeddings generated by the Recursive Reasoning Network.

# Seq2Seq model TO DO: 

- modify evaluate function to use the predictions form the previous step (ground truth for seq_length during val)
- do the above with batches
- two step training (train enc + dec then freeze enc and train regr) 
- random search of hyperparams
- define metrics
- increase regressor size

# Functions to write: 
- train_seq2seq_on_batch returns loss
- train_regressor_on_batch returns loss
- eval_network_on_batch (mode={eval_seq2seq, eval_reg, test}) returns loss

# Models to try: 
- concatenate vs seq
- EOS vs regressor
- model with teacher forcing 
- attention encore vs transformer
