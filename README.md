# video_annotation

Project to annotate videos with formal knowledge, using semantic embeddings generated by the Recursive Reasoning Network.

# Seq2Seq model TO DO: 

- modify evaluate function to use the predictions form the previous step (ground truth for seq_length during val)
- do the above with batches
- two step training (train enc + dec then freeze enc and train regr) 
- random search of hyperparams


# Models to try: 
- concatenate vs seq
- EOS vs regressor
- model with teacher forcing 
- attention encore vs transformer
